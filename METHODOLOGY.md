# Driving Cycle Synthesis Methodology

This document explains the methodology used in this project for synthesizing custom driving cycles from real-world data.

## Introduction

Driving cycles are speed-time profiles that represent typical vehicle operation patterns in specific environments. They are essential for:

- Vehicle energy consumption estimation
- Powertrain component sizing and optimization
- Energy management strategy development and testing
- Emissions testing and certification

This project provides tools to create custom, representative driving cycles by combining segments of real-world driving data.

## Process Overview

The driving cycle synthesis process follows these steps:

1. **Data Acquisition:** Obtain real-world driving data from the JRC database  
2. **Segment Selection:** Choose appropriate segments based on research needs  
3. **Data Extraction:** Process the CSV files to extract time, speed, and other parameters  
4. **Segment Combination:** Join selected segments into a continuous driving cycle  
5. **Statistical Analysis:** Calculate characteristic metrics for validation  
6. **Visualization:** Generate plots for visual verification and analysis  
7. **Export:** Save the processed data for use in simulation environments  

## Segment Selection Criteria

When selecting driving segments to combine, consider:

- **Driving Conditions:** Urban, suburban, highway, rural, etc.
- **Speed Distribution:** Low-speed city driving, medium-speed suburban, high-speed highway
- **Dynamics:** Segments with varying acceleration/deceleration patterns
- **Duration:** Appropriate length to capture representative behavior
- **Continuity:** Logical sequence that minimizes unrealistic transitions

## Time Alignment Method

The script aligns time values when combining segments using the following approach:

- The first segment's time values remain unchanged.
- For each subsequent segment:
  - The segment's time is shifted to start from the end time of the previous segment.
  - This creates a continuous timeline without gaps or overlaps.

```matlab
if i == 1
    combinedTime = timeData;
else
    lastTime = combinedTime(end);
    adjustedTime = timeData - timeData(1) + lastTime;
    combinedTime = [combinedTime; adjustedTime];
end
```

## Key Metrics for Cycle Characterization

To validate and characterize driving cycles, we calculate:

- **Mean Speed:** Average velocity over the cycle (m/s)
- **Maximum Speed:** Highest velocity reached (m/s)
- **Maximum Acceleration:** Highest positive rate of change in velocity (m/s²)
- **Maximum Deceleration:** Highest negative rate of change in velocity (m/s²)
- **Speed Standard Deviation:** Measure of speed variation (m/s)
- **Coefficient of Variation (CV):** Standard deviation divided by mean (dimensionless)

These metrics help ensure the synthesized cycle accurately represents desired driving conditions.

## Acceleration Calculation

Acceleration values are calculated as the rate of change in speed:

```matlab
dt = diff(timeData);
accelData = [0; diff(speedData) ./ dt];
```

The first value is set to zero since there is no preceding speed value for calculation.

## Validation Approach

To validate the synthesized driving cycle:

- **Statistical Comparison:** Compare key metrics between individual segments and the combined cycle.
- **Visual Inspection:** Examine speed profile plots for unrealistic transitions or patterns.
- **Purpose Evaluation:** Assess whether the combined cycle meets the specific research objectives.

## Use Cases for Synthesized Cycles

The driving cycles created with this methodology can be used for:

- **Energy Management Algorithm Development:** Testing and optimization of control strategies
- **Powertrain Simulation:** Evaluating component performance under realistic conditions
- **Vehicle Electrification Studies:** Sizing batteries and electric drivetrain components
- **Research on Specific Driving Conditions:** Creating representative cycles for particular environments

## Limitations and Considerations

When using this methodology, be aware of:

- **Transition Realism:** The joins between segments may not always represent realistic driving behavior.
- **Regional Differences:** Driving patterns vary by location and may not transfer between regions.
- **Vehicle Specificity:** Cycles created from one vehicle may not represent all vehicle types.
- **Temporal Factors:** Time of day, season, and traffic conditions affect driving patterns.
